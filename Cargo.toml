[features]
# Enable link-time assertions ensuring that core femtopb functions can't possibly panic.
# It is recommended to only enable this feature to perform a "test build" (but still using the "release" profile/with
# optimizations turned on) as enabling it for release builds might impact code generation negatively.
# Useful in embedded contexts where you want to write ultra-reliable code that can't fail unexpectedly, want to minimize
# code size without having to resort to `panic = "abort"`, or want to avoid trapping into the panic handler for other
# reasons.
